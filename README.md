#Not-Sports-Girl
Hi there! Glad you found my GitHub page.
This project was part of a university assessment. The task was to deliver a complete website consisting of a home page, individual product detail pages, an information page and a contact page. The additional pages will be developed using the WordPress Content Management System (CMS).  
The live demo page can be found on here https://66682d7e64e5a3f39b96f8c7--lively-alpaca-8173a6.netlify.app/
